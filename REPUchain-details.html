            look at credit
            score apps, which are useful to look at when you want to seek a loan, mortgage etc. I will do a comparative
            analysis
            using the SWOT method on Experian and Clear Score, this would help evaluate the feature existing within the
            apps, to
            determine what opportunities or weakness that could improve the user experience, and repeat use of the
            feature.</P>

          <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
          <P>Based on the comparative analysis, I wanted to gather user’s opinions and thoughts on their experience.
            However, rather
            than conducting a survey, I believe I wouldn’t reach a wide range of users, which would also provide a range
            of honest
            feedback. Therefore, I decided to use social media to gather the feedback on both Experian and ClearScore
            customer.
            Whilst researching, I wanted to find concerns, frustrations on credit scores, and then more specific to the
            apps/
            experience. This help outline the main difficulties, and what could potential be something I could improve.
            Below are
            some of the quotes, that provided from Twitter).</P>
          <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
          <p>With the data gathered from the comparative analysis, and through research I identified two types of users
            from the
            target demographic.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/REPUchain-design.svg" alt="" width="100%">
          </div>
          <h4>AFFINITY MAP</h4>
          <p>With the research being mainly qualitative, I need to help make sense of the user research using the
            thematic process –
            this is why I used affinity map. Here I could begin to group the themes of the comments and identify
            patterns. The way I
            did this was writing out the comment on sticky notes, and placing them into a group. To finish of I would
            make a
            statement of what that group is identifying with. I did this also using Aurelius, to try this on online
            platform. I
            think it was good to use an online platform to see how this would work in team, when presenting the
            feedback.</p>
          <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
          <P></P>
          <h4>USER JOURNEY MAP</h4>
          <p>Next stage, I believe that the User Journey Map be very useful here, as the personas & the research will
            prevent false
            assumption. Using this method, we can visualise how the user personas would interact with application. The
            exercise
            allows me to completely empathise with the user, can bring to light an insight into the user point of view.
            This is
            important to understand before brainstorming and creating potential solutions. In this particular scenario,
            the user is
            seeking to apply for a mortgage, but to do that needs any app that will indicate a transparent view of their
            score with
            actions. The next aspect would be creating a list of touch points with a reference to motivations, channels,
            actions and
            paint-points. This all layout into a step-by-step interaction. Whilst doing, this I can see the “ups” and
            “downs” of the
            experience – highlighting areas of refinements. I can use a empathy map in conjunction to this.</p>
          <h4>USER FLOW</h4>
          <p>The User Journey map, has been useful to understand the potential pain points during the map, which could
            improve the
            experience whilst using the app. This now allows me to segment and define each screen and track what screen
            the users
            will typically see. The key aspect that are focused into the three area which the wireframes will at
            refining.</p>
            <h4>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h4>
            <p>I sketched out the score dashboard, without the transparency feature linked with the score. The individual can set
            goals, link with notification to provide reminder or alerts on behaviours.</p>
            <h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
