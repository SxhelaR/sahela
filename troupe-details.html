            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Users find it difficult to identify what inventory they have, what amount and what needs replenishing.
            </p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>A design experience which shows what is required before a shop, translated into a shopping list.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>WHAT IS troupe?</h4>
            <p>troupe aims to help users shop more smartly. It takes the traditional shopping list and makes it digital,
              and serves as a personal inventory. Say bye to the days of overspending. </p>
            <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-design.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="100%">
            </div>
            <h4>OBSERVATIONS</h4>
            <p>One of the key things that was important here, was to observe human behaviour when they shop; 1) how
              people choose to
              make a purchase, 2) what their shopping routine is, 3) what do they do at home when they make food 4) how
              do they
              dispose of food. Whilst this may be common behaviour that I could explain from my perspective, I was keen
              not assume the
              obvious and prevent my own bias. I created a list on generic things people do and test this with a number
              of random
              people in the supermarket. I did this various observation, and tallied the behaviour. This was important,
              because I
              wanted to design an app that fitted into a shopping habit[1]. The observations were carried out on small
              selection of people over the course of 5 visits totally 20 people.</p>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-observation.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="70%">
            </div>
            <h4>SURVEY</h4>
            <p>In the observations, we found an increase use of phone checking during the course of the shopping
              experience compare to
              before and after[2]. This occurred when shoppers refer to their shopping list and checking products/offer
              during the same
              period. This demonstrates a digital shopping list, would replace the existing copy. The survey is useful
              here to
              understand how the shopping list is created. Whilst this maybe be a simple answer, what I am interested in
              understanding
              further are the factors involved in this process, because this would highlight a reoccurring problem
              within the paper
              shopping list that could solve using the digital design. The question was asked to a random selection of
              10 individuals.
              The aim was to gather thoughts, and was informal conversation. There were some standard questions I asked,
              as part of
              the conversation.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Is the shopping list create on weekly, daily basis?</li>

              <li>How is the shopping list create? i.e., Checking cupboard, memory</li>

              <li>Is the shopping list created on priority?</li>

              <li>Do you specify dates, amounts, and brands?</li>
            </ol>
            <div>

            <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
            <p>
              The based on the observation and survey, the persona is based on user that does the weekly family shop.
              This person
              is useful understanding the behaviour, needs and frustrations. With this captured, I can understand the
              user
              mindset in tackling the solution to the problem.</p>
            <div>

            </div>
            <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
            <p>The user is unable to track their household inventory via normal simple list to prevent overspending.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>STORYBOARD</h4>
            <p>Using the quantitive and qualitative data, I have I’ve turned into a storyboard.</p>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-storyboard.JPG" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-storyboard1.JPG" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-storyboard2.jpg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
            </div>
            <h4>SKETCH</h4>
            <p>For a quick and easy way to explore the potenial concept after creating the storyboard, I went on to sketch out the idea below.
              This is useful to make quick changes to the flow, and explore what may not work in this on this concept, has a good few different attemptd
              below I have the final version of the sketch [3].
            </p>
    <div>
      <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-sketch.jpg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="40%">
    </div>
            <h4>LF WIREFRAME</h4>
            <p>Building on the sketch, I have been able to develop the wireframes based on this, and added the components and features that would 
              work to meet the needs to the user perosna. </p>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-wireframe.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
      </div>
        <h4>UI DESIGN</h4>
        <p>Before creating the HF wireframes I have created a style guide which will be useful to ensure consistency across the design.</p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-ui.jpg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
        </div>
            <h4>HF WIREFRAME</h4>
            <p>Using the UI guide, I can now combine the LF wireframes with the branding. Below is the final version</p>
                  <div>
                    <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-hfwireframe.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="70%">
                  </div>

            <h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
            <p>Currently in process</p>

            <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
            <p>For this project, I wanted to change the way I did problem scoping, to see a different way of uncovering a problem. I
            found both observiations and surveys to be great tools to deal with qualitative information, and saw the importance of
            not forgetting about this type of data because it provides useful insight when translated into the storyboard. I
            wanted to make sure that it was based on a true narrative hence, the observations negated
            any false assumptions. As I have seen the qualitative data can differ from
            user to user, to find the theme you must group which is really useful.The second element was the reflection is  expanding my knowledge on useability
            testing. In this project, it was great to see the app, how it’s used and what that means. It definitely very different
            when you are selecting things to look at for, and how that mirrors what the user does. Usability testing, was important
            because it catches the gaps that maybe in earlier design processes wouldn’t catch. It a great comparison to check
            against the feedback on earlier attempts.</p>
