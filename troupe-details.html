            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Users find it difficult to identify what inventory they have, what amount and what needs replenishing.
            </p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>A design experience which shows what is required before a shop, translated into a shopping list.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>WHAT IS troupe?</h4>
            <p>troupe aims to help users shop more smartly. It takes the traditional shopping list and makes it digital,
              and serves as a personal inventory. Say bye to the days of overspending. </p>
            <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-design.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="100%">
            </div>
            <h4>OBSERVATIONS</h4>
            <p>One of the key things that was important here, was to observe human behaviour when they shop; 1) how
              people choose to
              make a purchase, 2) what their shopping routine is, 3) what do they do at home when they make food 4) how
              do they
              dispose of food. Whilst this may be common behaviour that I could explain from my perspective, I was keen
              not assume the
              obvious and prevent my own bias. I created a list on generic things people do and test this with a number
              of random
              people in the supermarket. I did this various observation, and tallied the behaviour. This was important,
              because I
              wanted to design an app that fitted into a shopping habit. The observations were carried out on small
              selection of people over the course of 5 visits totally 20 people.</p>

              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/troupe-observation.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="70%">
            </div>
            <h4>SURVEY</h4>
            <p>In the observations, we found an increase use of phone checking during the course of the shopping
              experience compare to
              before and after. This occurred when shoppers refer to their shopping list and checking products/offer
              during the same
              period. This demonstrates a digital shopping list, would replace the existing copy. The survey is useful
              here to
              understand how the shopping list is created. Whilst this maybe be a simple answer, what I am interested in
              understanding
              further are the factors involved in this process, because this would highlight a reoccurring problem
              within the paper
              shopping list that could solve using the digital design. The question was asked to a random selection of
              10 individuals.
              The aim was to gather thoughts, and was informal conversation. There were some standard questions I asked,
              as part of
              the conversation.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Is the shopping list create on weekly, daily basis?</li>

              <li>How is the shopping list create? i.e., Checking cupboard, memory</li>

              <li>Is the shopping list created on priority?</li>

              <li>Do you specify dates, amounts, and brands?</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
            <p>
              The based on the observation and survey, the persona is based on user that does the weekly family shop.
              This person
              is useful understanding the behaviour, needs and frustrations. With this captured, I can understand the
              user
              mindset in tackling the solution to the problem.</p>
