            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>The user is unable to collate their job applications that would help structure their energy on increasing
              their chances
              of getting employment.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Within the application tab, the user should be able to experience a linear cycle of applying, but with a
              record of
              information all in one place to refer to.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>WHAT IS allO Jobs?</h4>
            <p>allO Jobs is a career management tool, aimed at helping secure a role; whether that’s a graduate role,
              changing
              direction or simple moving up the career ladder.
            </p>
            <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
            <p>In this process, I will add the storyboard and paper prototype to the design phase to help brainstorm and
              understand the painpoint within the selected design. </p>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-design.svg" alt="" width="100%">
              <br>
            </div>
            <h4>INTERVIEWS</h4>
            <p>The interviews were conducted at random and there were no requirements to fill out this application, just
              that you were over 18 years old[1]. I interviewed 10 people, aged between 18 - 40. I asked
              the following questions:
            <ol>
              <li>Are you currently employed?</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>If Yes,</b> what are you next steps in your career journey?</li>
              <li>How do you think you would go about achieving this?</li>
              <li>What frustration would you/or have you encountered whilst doing this></li>
              <br>
              <li><b>If you answered no,</b>what are the current challenges you are facing on your job search?</li>
              <li>What has been an important element of the job search? i.e feedback </li>
              <li>How are you currently organise/managing your search?</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-interview.svg" alt="" width="100%">
            <p>The aim of these interviews was to build empathy of the user and how they would use the application.
              Above are a few comments that I have categorized in a themes, this will help
              inform the user persona.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
            <p>Based on the information gathered, I have collated three user persona’s that illustrate the key
              demographic of users
              that would be interested in using allO jobs. This will outline the needs, goal,
              motivation and the user's behaviour so I can empathise with how the product flow meets each
              need. Adding in the biography gives an explanation to the user's behaviour, and would
              help priorities
              which frustration is seen as a high priority compare to the others.</p>
            <div>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-persona.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="70%">
              <br>
            </div>
            <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
            <p>The user problem is that they are unable to manage and store applications/documents/notes processes in
              one which impacts their time. </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>STORYBOARD</h4>
            <p>To address this problem, I wanted to visualise this
              process via a
              storyboard. Through this, we can better understand how the user is going interact with the web application
              and
              can
              highlight persona is influenced by their goals[2]. I have used Sara's persona, as it demonstrates leaving a
              job
              and moving up for a senior positions.
            </p>

              <br>

              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-storyboard2.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="70%">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>PAPER PROTOTYPE</h4>
            <p>Now having gained a better understanding of the persona’s behaviours, and identified common thread
              between the
              personas’. I wanted to mock up a design were I could brainstorming a few different variation of features on
              the screens
              that would work for three user personas [3]. By using the paper
              prototype, it will hightlight was it priorities and make changes in real time, to collect the feedback. This was converted into a digital version for the purpose of the portfolio.
              I tested this
              on 5 people
              I interviewed earlier. After reflecting on my first
              UX project,
              one of the main things I wanted to ensure was that I got feedback.</p>
            <h5>Dashboard View</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-paper1.png" alt="" width="100%">
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Application View</h5>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-paper2.png" alt="" width="100%">
            <p> I decided to focus on the dashboard and application view. I created a few iterations on different features or how they should be arranged. 
              One of the main concerns was the number of clicks. After a few changes, the final arrangement was agreed in grey, this helped reduce the number of clicks overall. </p>

            <h4>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMING</h4>
            <p>Taken on the testing feedback from the paper prototyping, I can now to begin to map out the flow for
              the whole
              application to create the LF wireframes. The main pages of focus are the login page,
              dashboard and application view.</p>
              <div>
                <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-wireframe.png" alt="" width="100%">
          </div>

              <h4>UI DESIGN</h4>
              <div>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-ui.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="55%">
              </div>
            <h4>HIGHT-FIDELITY WIREFRAME</h4>
            <p>I created the LF wireframes in Balsamiq and put it together in figma. The high-fidelity
              prototype
              allowed feedback on whether the problem synthesis was the right, and solution created works for its users
              during the
              design stage. 
              <div class="portfolio-details-container">
                <div class="owl-carousel portfolio-details-carousel">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-prototype1.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-prototype2.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-prototype3.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/allO-prototype4.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
             <p>I returned back to my interview group to test the prototype. There were positive comments on
              the easy
              collation of applications as well the reduction in clicks which welcome a positive experience. There was
              confusion over
              the button “mark as” - this was cleared up with “mark stage as”. Overall, the usability of the web
              application achieves
              a more efficient layout, the overall comments is that the users would continuously return to use this.</p>
        <h4>USABILITY TESTING</h4>
          
        
            <h4>REFLECTIONS</h4>
            <p>One of the main elements of this project has focused on the design stage. It’s been useful to see how
              much design
              ideation and testing can take place, and just like a funnel effect it has allow me to narrow down the
              potential solution
              before moving into the prototype stage. This has worked well, when moving back and forth while ensuring I
              have engaged
              with the user personas and the interviewees in order to prevent my own bias – keeping the user at the
              centre of the
              design. The paper prototype was quick and effective to test, and worked well in addressing the issues of
              layout and
              highlight the concern over the unnecessary amounts of clicks. This mapped out the relevance of additional
              pages which
              made me reconfigure prioritized elements, but also thinking ahead about some of the less prioritized
              features that would
              bode well for further user experience as the web application develops. The big take way from this project,
              showed me to
              focus on the detail but not forget the bigger picture. I think the next element would use usability
              testing of the
              prototype, to see any doubt or confusions about the process. This something I would develop in my next
              project.</p>
