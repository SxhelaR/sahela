                      <p class="mb-30">Often the process of creating starts with an idea for a design. Then we made some
                        changes, and more than often it
                        becomes more complex. Ok, once we have done that a few times over, we decide it time to show our
                        work to someone else.
                        They will give their insights and mostly likely we’ll mull over the feedback. Then maybe ask
                        another person if we are
                        not confident with the first piece of feedback. We may decide to share the original idea so they
                        can compare. They come
                        back, and say they really like the latest design. Hoorah! However, there is a niggling feeling
                        that we’re missing
                        something, and we can’t put our finger on it. Curiosity strikes again.</p>


                      <p class="mb-30">With this in mind, we go back to the first piece of feedback. Makes some changes
                        to see how we feel about it. It seems to be
                        going the right way, something is clearly working. Hmmmm. Now, we need to check this will more
                        than one person. Contact
                        a few friends to see whether they could look at it. Emails sent. Before they even respond back
                        – we are attempting to
                        work out what they might say. Opens the internet browser, we are looking for some further
                        inspiration.</p>

                      <blockquote>No such thing as an end design, just one that allows for more changes</blockquote>

                      <p class="mb-30">
                        About 8pm, they get back to us. The feedback was on average good with additional comments about
                        colour, arrangement, and
                        text. Mostly predicted but there is a one comment we did not consider. Great! How do we fit this
                        in? We continue to
                        google and play about until we found a way that works. Feeling quite satisfied, we continue to
                        build out the design – we
                        are in a flow. The colour and theme are starting to form now.</p>

                      <p class="mb-30">
                        We move on to functionality – we want people to use this. We think to ourselves, what is the
                        most logical pattern in
                        human behaviour that works with this design. We get a piece of paper, and jot down various forms
                        of logic on user flow. A
                        few attempts later, a
                        couple of scribbles here and there – found that one most logical to us. Now we have a functional
                        idea with a design. Now
                        we need to test this with a far bigger audience. How? We deploy the idea online, allow people to
                        test it. Collect the
                        feedback once they’ve use it. Now, this time, we are not completely sure what we might expect.
                        We take some time off
                        until everything is collected and reviewed…. </p>

                      <p class="mb-30">
                        Ok, so nearly there. Read through the comments, some rather interesting points. To know which
                        one works best, we decided
                        to test the logic. Noting down at the same time on how easy it is to more through the design.
                        Ranking each one,
                        including both positive/ negative comments. It’s seems we have our top three logical pathway we
                        can test to our users.
                        Test, test, test again!
                        Interestingly, there clearly seems to be a frontrunner here. </p>

                      <p class="mb-30">
                        Ah, but how does this make people feel about it?
                        Ahh well that changes it again.
                      </p>


                      <p class="mb-30">
                        Ok pause, lets compare the original design to where we are now.
                      </p>
