            <h3 style="text-align: center;">UI Design</h3>
            <p>UI Design stands for user interface, and it contains graphical layout of the application. This can consist of buttons,
            images, sliders, text entry field, searches, and anything else the user would interact with. The aim is to help make the
            experience aesthetically pleasing, the interaction as simple and for the user to be able meets their needs [1].
            <br>
            In the project I wanted to expand and develop my process when creating UI components and produce the overall design of
            the application. At this point I have work on UX projects and cover some element of UI. But by breaking this down
            further, I can examine element of UI design more closely, and reflect on the learnings I observe by differentiating
            between the UX & UI. By being able to delve into UI, I can also begin to appreciate cohesion that is required by both UX
            and UI.</p>
            <h4>APP CONCEPT</h4>
            <p>The problem addressed within my app, responds to difficulty for music creator who produce/record music are unable to
            match with companies/organisation who would buy for there use.
            <br>
            KAPE provides a platform that gives music creator control over their music dissemination.</p>
            <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
            <p>As with UX design process, I have also added a process in for UI. This helps visual the steps that build up the UI, and
            factor in various considerations that contribute to developing the branding, design and overall message to the user.</p>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-design.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="90%">
            </div>
            <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
            <p>User persona is a UX tool, however, can be useful in understanding the behaviour of our user. UI design essentially at
            the heart of providing an experience that works for its users. There are three personas’ reflective of different
            occupations and backgrounds – but all producer or creator of music. There are few things that are of interest, firstly
            how they share their music, what music influence they have and how much time they spend creating. Using this
            information, I can begin to identity the common thread in music sharing platform, in terms of their visual
            communication, secondly, what element will be important in the app and needs defining in the wireframes.</p>
            <div>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-persona.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="90%">
            </div>
            <h4>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAME</h4>
            <p>With the creation of the user persona, I now can better understand the user interest and behaviours. Using this
            information, I can create low fidelity wireframes which the specific feature address the users needs.</p>
            <div>
              <p>1. Landing Page (demonstates the users registering/login process)</p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-wireframe1.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
              <p>2. Profile (shows the different views avaliable in the profile tab).</p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-wireframe2.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="40%">
              <p>3. Message (inbox and chat view) </p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-wireframe3.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="30%">
              <p>4. Broadcast (shows how user can improve their visibility and successful collaboration)</p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-wireframe4.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="20%">
              <p>5. Matches (demonstrates how the ads are shown to a user).</p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-wireframe5.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="15%">
            </div>
            <h4>VISUAL LANGUAGE</h4>
            <p>Visual language is communicating though visual elements. This can relate to the perception, comprehension and production
            of visible sign that can be interpreted by our brains and turn into an emotion/reaction. Visual language requires
            patterns that communicate a message, which gives consistency, connects with the user and established a strong brand
            identity [2]. For this project, there are a few considerations on the colour palette, logo, brand, font, and tone of
            information that we want user to be familiar and responsive to. As I mentioned earlier looking at the already existing
            music streaming applications would help with this aspect.
            <br>
            <br>
            To explore this, we need to use design inception worksheet, this will help brainstorm the considerations in one space.
            The main areas of focus are space, shape, movement, colour, and mood. Before doing the design inception, I needed to
            centre the purpose of the app, and the benefits to the user. During the process, I can keep the user in mind, whilst
            working on these considerations. This will help inform the colour palette, typography, UI components and rules for over
            consistency.
            <br>
</p>
            <ul>
              <ol>a) Why users would want to use this?</ol>
              <ol>b) What type of mood that would be associate with this paritcular idea?</ol>
              <ol>c) How would you communicate this mood through the visual communication?</ol>
            </ul>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-visualcoms.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="60%">
            </p>
            <h4>MOOD BOARD</h4>
            <p>Using the design inception, I have identified and group two moods that be further understood using the mood board
            process. The mood board will help articulate feeling associated with the concept and created in a visual view. This help
            identity which mood is more representative of the overall concept. The first mood is cool, creative, and minimal
            conveying inspiration and approachability relevant for building a profile. The second one is energetic, fast-pace and
            dynamic which suits the overall aims of enabling connection and collaboration.</p>
         <div>
          <img src="assets/img/portfolio/kape-mood.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="60%">
         </div>
         <h4>STYLE TILE</h4>
         <p>The mood board help understand colour palette and moods that are representative of the concept. The style tile takes
        this one step further in relation to the visual elements and UI components based on the LF wireframe. This was a quick
        mock-up for both moods, to allow me compare contrast. The first style fits into creative mood and minimal style
        reflective of the music sharing platforms, and there is a good balance of contrast to keep this young and relevant to
        the user target audience.
         </p>

  </div>
  <h4>STYLE GUIDE</h4>
  <p>Below is a style guide that has been used to create the High-fidelity wireframes. This can be used and updated when new
  additional and feature are added. This helps ensure consistency in pattern throughout the app, moreover, help ensure the
  same messaged and brand identity.</p>

  </div>
  <h4>Reflections</h4>
  <p>I have enjoyed working through the UI process for KAPE, it helps me really focus in on the various elements involved in
  creating the right visual language for user, something you would normally underestimate. To go through this process, it
  great to see the results and how much each process has inform one another just like in UX Research. More importantly, I
  have been able to appreciate the importance of UI design being a main factor as to how someone interact and returns to
  the app, based on the visual/interactive experience more than UX research. Poor design would leave the UX research at
  waste – there is harmony between the two that needs to work in sync. Something I would look into greater detail is icons
  within apps – an area I could delve in deeper as its an element that feature quite prominently in applications.</p>
