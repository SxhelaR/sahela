          <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
          <p>Need to complete</p>
          <h4>Comparative Analysis</h4>
          <p>Comparative analysis is useful for me to collect and compare data about different products that exist in
            the
            marketplace. I can gather useful information on the key user demographic, list of the features and conduct
            an evaluation
            of the visual design language. Given there is a wide range of products similar to the one I have created, I
            will look
            for comparatives based on creator platforms.</p>
          <h4>USER PERSONAS</h4>
          <p>Based on the comparative analysis, I have created four user persona’s that represent the demographics. This
            outlines the
            behaviours, needs, goals and I also want to capture the reach the user personas have on social media. I
            believe this
            element is important to our users, and should remain central consideration when working through the ideation
            stage.</p>
          <h4>BRAINSTORMING</h4>
          <p>Normally, when I have brainstormed it’s involved thinking in a pro-solution mindset, in other words, what
            potential
            alternative solutions can be created that works. However, this time round I want to work with creating a
            number of
            alternatives that don’t work, though this process I want to understand why it wouldn’t work, and so gathered
            information
            that will allow me to empathise with the user. The aim of this process is to highlight what the actual
            issues are,
            before drawing out possible solution during wireframing. I am already challenging my own thinking to prevent
            bias.</p>
          <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
          <p>Reflecting on the previous methods I used for social media research – the thematic process allowed me to
            find, group and
            identify patterns. In the same way, I wanted to find a pattern in what user found important in relation to
            the structure
            of the information architecture. The reason why I think using card sorting will help because, to me it will
            show how
            users will group but also what is prioritised. Card sorting is particularly relevant here, because the
            solution I am
            trying to solve involves organise the structure of the end-end timescale visible to the users.</p>
          <h4>USER FLOW</h4>
          <p>Between the brainstorming session and card sorting, this has identified the use case for the screens, it
            shows the menu
            and options for the user actions and showing the impact of the choices they make. It keeps the focus, and
            define the
            scope of what we are working towards and gives me also the chance to visual the design and iterate where
            necessary
            before wireframing.</p>
          <h4>LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAMING</h4>
          <p>I want to show the iteration process on the Low fidelity wireframing, to see how I have responded to the
            feedback and
            changes, and explain my process in detail as it been something I haven’t done in real dept, and something I
            would like
            to develop further on.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Iteration 1</li>
            <li>Iteration 2</li>
            <li>Iteration 3</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>PROTOTYPING</h4>
          <p>I used Figma to starting building out a clickable prototype.
            In this instance, I can get to see how the feature will function, where they will appear in specific pages
            and how
            useful it will be. I get see how the interaction works, if the flow is logical and natural to
            human
            behaviour.</p>
            <h4>User Testing </h4>
            <p>Results</p>

          <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
          <p>I have loved being able to explore and change things as I work through the process. It’s not looking for
            the ideal
            situation, it’s saying what have we got and what can we do with it. I have found myself fully embracing this
            as I have
            worked on this project, particularly looking at the priorities of the sorting cards. In my own bias, I would
            have
            organised based on what I would have thought was logical, and evidently see this was different mine after
            the evaluation
            of the task. This allowed me to work with what I was given to determine a different workable solution, which
            I found the
            mindset to adopt to be super useful. In alternative approach I decide to look at the creating bad solution
            for the
            problem, to understand what would lead to the effective solution. By turning this on its head, got me
            thinking with two
            different hats on which I could then go back and forth in the brainstorming session to come up a solution
            that holds up
            – this really helped me empathise with the users which I found constructive.</p>
