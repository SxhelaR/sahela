<h3 style="text-align: center;">UI DESIGN</h3>
        <div class="portfolio-description">
          <h4>WEBSITE CONCEPT (Desktop)</h4>
          <p>The focus of this product is providing a service via website (Desktop Version). The user will be allowed to come online
          and have access to relevant resources on Pilates to help drive their fitness goals. The potential users would range from
          beginner to advance. Through my person research and reading, develop of UI design normally adopt the view of mobile
          first. However, I wanted to break this down into two separate projects, and to reflect individually on my learning
          experience.</p>
          <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
          <p>UI design process is outlined below:</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/pilatespi-design.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="80%">
          </div>
          <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
          <p>The user persona is important to understand the user age, demographic as well as their behaviour, goals/needs. This
          helps frames the userâ€™s mindset and how they would go about interacting with the website. This a useful tool to keep
          referring to throughout the whole UI design process. In this example, we have two personas, that are reflective of two
          different skills levels and a reference to their lifestyle to. This indicates how often they would engage with the
          online website, and what information they would want to see, this will help create the site map too.</p>
<div>
  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/pilatespi-persona.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="80%">
</div>
<h4>SITEMAP</h4>
<p>The sitemap for the purpose of this project is to the understand the purpose and structure on the site. For me this
would help inform what screens are needed during the LF wireframes and prioritize what is shown. The normal use of
sitemap can help inform google of the priority of the pages on the website, and this would be a consideration of
creating one provided the website was live. The second purpose can help user navigate through website and pages and can
be broken down into content too [1].
<br>

The below shows the overall structure of the website:
</p>
<h4>LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAME</h4>
<p>The wireframe has been organise based on the site map and what the user personas considered imported to fulfil their
needs and goals.</p>
<div>
  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/pilatespi-sitemap.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="60%">
</div>
<h4>VISUAL LANGUAGE</h4>
<p>The visual language for the theme of this website, will build on the consistency and cohesion with Pilatesâ€™s theme. To
communicate the services on the website, I will need to identify common links in Pilates, relevant to the font, space,
shape, movement that could be highlighted and bring a sense of relevance and familiarity to the user. This would aim to
engage with the user and follow the step outline on the website. To understand the visual language, I need to carry out
a design inception worksheet.</p>
<h4>DESIGN INCEPTION</h4>
<p>Using the worksheet, I was able to refer to the user personas to build out association made with the service provided.
Pilates is a muscles and strength-based exercise, so much of the association is with movement, space, and shape as this
is reflected on the types of exercise done through Pilates. The second association was colour, much of Pilates is
grounded by soft colours and reflective of lightness and peace - good colours associated with this service are pastel
colours. This information brainstorms helps centred what the user expectation would be, this brings a sense of
familiarity/interest in the user.</p>
<div>
  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/pilatespi-visualcoms.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="60%">
</div>
<h4>MOODBOARD</h4>
<p>Using the associate key words, I went on to google to gather resources that would visual the mood of the website. I also
wanted to validate whether the associations were true to the key message of what services would be provided. The mood
board below, demonstrate the validity of the key words associated during the inception design worksheet.</p>
<div>
  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/pilatespi-mood.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
</div>
<h4>STYLE TILE</h4>
<p>Taking the mood board and now developing into a more detail version of what the website could look like. I have taken
the shapes and colour, convert this into components to visual the arrangements of how the website would look and convey
the message of Pilates, its purpose etc. I have focused on images and using shapes/curves to reflect the different
exercise/fluidity, pastel colours/ opaqueness to demonstrate relaxation and peacefulness. This is always good to do,
because it quick and easy to play around see what works.</p>
<div>
  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/pilatespi-tile.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
</div>
<h4>STYLE GUIDE</h4>
<p>The combination of the mood board and style tile has given clear direction of what type of messages are being conveyed
thought the website, and it true to what the user would like to see. I have collated the information broken down into
four distinct categories which will be later used to help build out the HF wireframe. Those categories are colour,
typography, iconography, and UI components.</p>
<div>

</div>
<h4>HIGH FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h4>
<p>Using the LF wireframes and the style guide, the final version can be viewed below.</p>

<h4>REFLECTION</h4>   
<p>Website UI design allows you think of space and how to use it. This can be great in one sense, because you fit various
elements on the other hand, you must be careful not overwhelm the user with too much information or content. I guess
with a mobile first approach, most the time you prioritise what elements are important and transfer that into a bigger
screen and where necessary add in a few more elements. This was a good project, because it allowed me to see this sort
of issues that could arise. The site map was particularly useful as to how I prioritized what was on the website,
something I could use when working of client project. The other aspect that I found quite interest and unique to this
project the reduce use of icons. I did go and research into other service website, and this was apparent â€“ again another
insight I would not have thought about. If there was another element I would have added, it would have thought about
user accessibility and how that would affect the current design I have created. It is something to return back and see
what impact/different this would make to the user.
