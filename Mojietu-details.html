          <h3 style="text-align: center;">UI DESIGN</h3>
          <h4>Website Concept (Mobile)</h4>
          <p>In this project I wanted to move onto to create a mobile website, this builds on or follows from PilatesPI, where I had
          worked on the UI design of a desktop website. Rather than build the same concept and create two view both mobile &
          desktop. I wanted to break this process down and reflect on individual from a learning perspective. There will be
          another project that will focus later.
          For this project, I have decided to work on consumer facing website. The objective is to create brand/UI design
          representative of the product and communicate its benefit to secure a sale. The information/text is from the product
          existing description.
</p>
          
          <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
          <p>Below I have outlined the design process I shall follow.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu-design.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="80%">
          </div>
          <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
          <div>
            <p>The user persona is useful here to understand how the user would interact with the website, what they are looking for,
            and how they would like something to be communicated to them.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have three user personas’, which depict different needs, behaviours and goals. When thinking about the visual
            language, this will be useful exercise to refer to and help centre the UI design around my users.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu-persona.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="80%">
          </div>
          <h4>USER FLOW</h4>
          <p>Using the user personas’, I wanted to map out what the user flow would look like and the potential solution to sure a
          purchase from the user. Here, I am keen to reduce the number of click and make the checkout process as simple as
          possible. I want to reduce the overall bounce back rate. Whilst this may be a UX tool, it is relevant here, because
          helps focus the low-fidelity wireframe creation [1].</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu-userflow.png" alt="" class="centerImage" width="90%">
          </div>
          <h4>LOW-FIDELITY WIFREFRAME</h4>
          <p>Based on the User flow I can now begin to draft out what the mobile website would look like. I can visual how the user
          would interact and at what point they would make decision. This also highlights how many screens I will need to create
          and where information and visual element may need to be displayed.</p>
          <h4>VISUAL LANGUAGE</h4>
          <p>In this project I am not just creating the concept, I am marketing the brand and the product. To create an effective UI
          design, this means to communicate a consistent message in line with the brand identity. To achieve this, I need to think
          about a few considerations, visual elements that relates to emotions, patterns, colour, space, and movement [2]. With
          the combination of all these considerations, I should be able to uncover a consistency within the brand and overall
          communication of the message to the user. The aim of this should illustrate a sense of understanding of the website and
          trustworthiness of the brand.</p>
          <h4>DESIGN INCEPTION WORKSHEET</h4>
          <p>To do this, I have used a design inception worksheet that takes account of all these considerations [3]. It was
          effective way to brainstorm different ideas around each of the theme and organises into neat categories. I used the user
          persona to inform the output of the exercise. At the heart of the design inception, was clarifying the “why”, this was
          good way of centring what type of associations are made. I can use this information and translate this into the mood
          board and style tile, to help picture the visual language.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu - visualcoms.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="50%">
          </div>
          <h4>MOOD BOARD</h4>
          <p>Using the different words and associate created during the design inception worksheet, I went on to googled keywords,
          and started gathering various images, colours and type of layout that would work with the overall visual language. I
          then looked at the patterns within the resources I had gathered and found two themes that the user personas would be
          reflective of. The theme was cool and confident; this was reflective of the contemporary and smart solution of the
          portability of the inflator. The second theme was contrasted and dynamic; this was reflective of modern high-tech
          solution to inflating. Both themes represented the minimal shape and wide space.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu-mood.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="80%">
          </div>
          <h4>STYLE TILE</h4>
          <p>The next step was to take the mood board and now start developing into style tile. The above exercise helped capture the
          type of mood and general idea of what I want to create for the user. Now the next step is to turn this into something
          more concrete, with more visual elements that will communicate the brand and message [4]. This is where I have now
          started to drip down into the potential interfaces, fonts, icons, buttons, and menu. It is a time effective exercise
          before moving onto building out the wireframe, I can iterate very quickly. It also provides the vocabulary and small
          snippet of what something will look like. This has been helpful foe me to compare both themes based on the potential
          visual language that could be communicated on, I have chosen the cool and confidant theme that is reflective of the
          smart solution offered by the products.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu-tile.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="80%">
          </div>
          <h4>STYLE GUIDE</h4>
          <p>The last step of this process if the style guide. The creation of the style guide is a great development tools that help
          bring together the consistency, patterns overall experience for the user. This help keep the visual language clear to
          the users, and what the brand should communicate to them. It a library, that can be use when creating high fidelity
          wireframes, which will help reduced the creation time. In this style guide I have collated the design element, UI
          components, colour palette and the typography [5]. I have shown a breakdown below.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/mojietu-ui.svg" alt="" class="centerImage" width="90%">
          </div>
          <h4>REFLECTIONS</h4>
          <p>Mobile UI design has different design challenges a desktop website/application mainly because the user is looking to
          navigate with far less clicks than was it maybe what is tolerated on a desktop version. The space in far more limited
          and requires more questions on what UI component or visual elements are deemed necessary, this was an earlier thought
          process during the user flow and LF wireframes. For this project, it was the typography that was critical, the
          information is something a user looks for when purchasing or interested in learning more about the product, so the tones
          and use of font correctly would demonstrate brand trustworthiness and convey the confidence to buy. Another
          consideration, was using the wireframes as method of identifying reoccurring components to would create familiarity
          throughout the experience, demonstrated in the final UI design. One element I would I have looked into more depth was
          the animation factor, something to consider on a future project.</p>
