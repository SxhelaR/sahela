          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p></p>Users are unable to view and organise accomodations viewings. </p>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>To create a link between the messages, notification and calandar to orgranise accomodations search.</p>
          <hr>
          <h4>WHAT IS 6bedrooms?</h4>
          <p>The app aims at help renters through the process of looking for accommodation with ease.</p>
          <h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
          <p>The problem that is being ask, looks at the addition of a new feature that would help users organize and
            manage their
            viewings. My first aim is to take an empathetic approach to the problem. I have decided to gain user
            feedback on needs
            from users targeting the demographic age of 18-30 years. The next element is to look at existing apps on the
            market,
            aimed at the demographic age range, selecting three most popular apps to conduct a comparative analysis.
            Finally, going
            on to create two user personas’, that includes the observations I have engaged with, and empathize with
            users to
            understand their experience and motivation for using those apps. Using the above information, I will be able
            to
            synthesis define the problem statement and move on to solve it.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next stage will involve design, brain storming a number of different ways to solve the problem. Here,
            the answer
            lies on what feature and flow will connect the user experience of managing their viewings efficiently. This
            is where
            mapping out the user flow will be efficient at generating alternative ways for viewing the problem.
            Following on, I will
            begin to create LF wireframes, to help visual the user flow to check against whether the user flow works.
            <br>
            <br>
            The final stages will bring all the information from the ideation phases, to create a prototype. This will
            assess
            whether the function of the prototype will help solve the define problem. This is important for understand
            the
            constraining and problems with this particular solution, providing a clear view of how the real user would
            behave, think
            and feel when they interact with the end feature. This would answer the question on whether the user
            experience will be
            improved by this feature.

          <h4>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
          <p>The user should be able to locate their perferred accommodation,
            able to send messages, arrange viewings, calendar notifications contract exchange and much more, within the
            flow of the app.

          <h4>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
          <div>
            <p>I looked at the three most popular room-sharing apps that is used largely by the target demographic. I
              look that current
              features that exist and compare the feature looking at the pros and cons. The competitors are spareRoom
              (spareroom.com)
              offering roommates & rooms to rent in the UK and US. Roomster (roomster.com) offers rooms in 192
              countries. Badi
              (badi.com) offering rooms/flatshares in Europe.</p>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The major gaps in the existing apps, is a lack of organization and management of viewings from one
              central place within
              the flow of the app itself. There is no access to make it easier to accept, reject viewing based on
              real-time changes to
              ensure both the renter and landlord are aware of this. In the survey, I found a need to ensure that this
              can happen to
              ensure the right room is found for them based on their criteria.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>USER PERSONA</h4>
          <p>The user persona has been based on the prior research conduct during the survey and comparative analysis in
            order to
            create the empathy whilst designing the possible solutions. The personas’ have been created based on the
            target
            demographic of which the app attracts and survey data collect (18–30 age bracket). Here, the persona’s
            includes age,
            gender, occupation, interest combined with their goals and frustrations whilst searching for rooms. They are
            distinctive
            to their lifestyles. This now helps organize their information into behaviors, needs, goals/ motivations to
            product the
            feature that would be useful to the users.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/6bedrooms-persona.svg" alt="" width="100%">
          </div>

          <h4>USER FLOW</h4>
          <p>Here, the user flow is helping determine how many screens will be needed, what order they should appear and
            what
            components need to be present. The user flow address two key questions: when do we show specific bits of
            information and
            how do we respond to the user behaviour? In this user flow, we have added the
            Calander/Notification/Invitation features,
            which runs through the logic of user experience at the said stage. The feature added, flows within the
            context of the
            app, and its aim. Therefore, does not get lost in just being an additional feature. The overview is giving a
            high-level
            view of what each stage would look like without too much detail. This helps align with the user personas to
            stay
            coherent, this keeps it simple to validate the idea and address the pain point, in this case organizing the
            viewings.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/6bedrooms-userflow.svg" alt="" width="100%">
          </div>
          <h4>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMING</h4>
          <p>Moving forward, I wanted to visualize what that user flow would look like with the structure, and the
            contents within, I
            did this using FlowMapp. This first visual provides the representation of the ideation and exploration of
            the
            needs/motivations of the users. This has allowed me to see how possible the flow and design can work, where
            there might
            be some constraints. Below, has shown that it is possible to integrate the feature without disrupting the
            other
            elements. This has taken a few iterations, in order to place the content in the right places. But this is
            help makes
            changes in the wireframe to then be develop into a high-fidelity wireframe. This process brings clarity by
            viewing a
            solid layout and very easy to change before getting to the right balance.</p>
          <div>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/6bedrooms-wireframe.png" alt="" width="100%">
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMING</h4>
          <p>Confident in understanding the flow and general structure I used Figma to starting building out a clickable
            prototype.
            In this instance, I can get to see how the feature will function, where they will appear in specific pages
            and how
            useful it will be. This now starts to cut down on the room for assumptions and doubts on flow/feature and
            begin to bring
            the colour, design and style. I get see how the interaction works, if the flow is logical and natural to
            human
            behaviour.</p>
          <div>
            <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>REFLECTIONS</h4>
          <p>Over the course of my first UX project, I realized the importance of keeping the user central in the whole
            process. It
            was easier to begin, and to think of what I would see fit however ensuring I remember the users via the user
            persona’
            allowed me to iterate over the designs. This helped focus on what the user pain point were, and every change
            made the
            feature fit wells and work more smoothly with logic. If I could one change, is adding another step by
            getting feedback
            on the LF wireframes, checked against any other issues that could have been spotted. This would encourage
            further
            conversions on whether there could have been an alternative solution. On the whole, the project has been
            great to work
            through the problems, and think from the user perspective, and has allow me to problem synthesis and a
            solution for my
            first project.</p>
